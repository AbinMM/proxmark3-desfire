The client compiles on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (MinGW/MSYS).

it requires:
- gcc
- libpthread
- libreadline
- libusb

and optionally libQT


To compile, just run "make".

==========
= MingGW =
==========
It is known to work using:
- MingW 5.1.6
- MSYS 1.0.11
- libpthread 2.8.0 (from MinGW or directly from pthread-win32)
- readline 5.0 from gnuwin32
- libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2
  Be careful here, it is *NOT* working with the filter version!
  You have to use the device version and use the inf-wizard
  to create a driver for your proxmark and install it.

Setting up the Windows "client folder" compile environment.

Download MinGW-5.1.6.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/

Run it, click next, leave "Download and Install" selected, click next
Agree to license, leave "Current" selected, click next
Select "MinGW base" and "MinGW make", click next
Select installation folder, click next, Install, click next and finish.

CAUTION! When extracting the downloaded archives further down in this guide,
make sure that the contents of the archive directories go into the MinGW
installation directories, eg archive bin goes to MinGW bin, archive lib to
MinGW lib, etc, otherwise if the archive extracts into it's own subdirecory
the paths to the files will be all wrong.

You should now have the base MinGW installed in whatever installation folder
you selected earlier. By default it installs GCC 3.4.5 so if you want to
go to GCC 4.4 go back to http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/ and
download gcc-full-4.4.0-mingw32-bin-2.tar which includes the ADA, Fortran,
Java, etc compilers as well, but it is by far the easiest for newbees to
download and install as it already includes pthreads and a few other
libraries/dlls required by the GCC compiler.

After download, extract it into the MinGW installation directory, see
caution note above.

Download readline from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/readline/5.0-1/readline-5.0-1-bin.zip/download
Extract it into the MinGW installation directory, see caution note above.

Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/0.1.12.2/libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2.tar.gz/download
Extract it into the MinGW installation directory, see caution note above.

By default, the installer should have set your system path to the MinGW
installation \bin directory, verify this by opening a command prompt and
typing "gcc -v". You should get some text output indicating the version of
your GCC compiler (either 3.4.5 or 4.4 depending on what you installed).
If you get "unrecognized command", you must set the path manually.

Download MSYS from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe
Run it and just follow the defaults. A post install configuration screen
will come up asking you some questions, answer yes to continue, then yes
to having MinGW installed then enter the path to the MinGW installation.
I believe it needs unix slashes so use c:/blah/

Manually add the MSYS bin directory to you system path.

You can now run 0setpath.bat and 3makewin.bat in the cockpit and have the
client compiled.
