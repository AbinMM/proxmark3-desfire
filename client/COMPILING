The client compiles on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows (MinGW/MSYS).

it requires:
- gcc
- libpthread
- libreadline
- libusb

and optionally libQT


To compile, just run "make".

===========
= Windows =
===========
The following is a complete list of packages required to setup the compile environment yourself. Alternatively you can download an archive of the full environment (see below).

1 - Install QT SDK for Windows [1]

In the following instructions, we'll assume you installed it to C:\QT

2 - MSYS-1.0.11 [2]

Just follow the installation procedure.
When asked if you have MinGW installed and for its path, provide:
C:/QT/mingw

3 - readline-5.0-1-bin [5]

From this archive, copy:
bin/* to C:\QT\mingw\bin
include/* to C:\QT\mingw\include
lib/*.a to C:\QT\mingw\lib

4 - libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2 [6]

Be careful here, it is *NOT* working with the filter version!
Likewise copy:
include/usb.h to C:\QT\mingw\include
lib/gcc/libusb.a to C:\QT\mingw\lib

Rather than download and install every one of these packages, a new ProxSpace
environment archive file will be made available for download on the project
